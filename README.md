# Safe-Drive
Driver Drowsiness Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks.

We see many accidents happening due to the drowsiness of the driver. This project is developed to address this problem. The video input of the driver is taken continuously and frames extracted from it are given to the model for detecting if the eyes are open or closed. If the eyes are closed for a certain time, alarm is raised to alert the driver.

Keras is used for Model building and OpenCV for Video Capture.
